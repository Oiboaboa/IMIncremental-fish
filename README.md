# IMIncremental-fish
auto fisher

Well, good luck installing it. Ask ChatGPT if you don’t understand what I wrote, or if it’s still not working afterward.


install studio code install python(easier if u use microsoft store for some reason)

these are the pip installs u need
pip install mss numpy pynput keyboard
copy the pip command to the cmd
to open cmd just search in your windows bar 'cmd'

next u find where your macro.py is 
then on the cmd use: cd 'stop its at'
then to run it use 'python macro.py' if yours as macro as its name


the macro works if u have roblox on full screen if u want to use it while minimized u will need to change the code
to use just leave the mouse on top of the fishing rode icon to start press F3 to stop F3 to stop it from running F4 or crtl-c on cmd
dont forget to pause the macro when u want to stop fishing or its going to click verywhere
