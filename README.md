Well, good luck installing it. Ask ChatGPT if you don’t understand what I wrote, or if it’s still not working afterward.

1. Install Visual Studio Code (use good old google to install) and install Python (easier if you use the Microsoft Store for some reason).
2. Install the needed Python packages by opening Command Prompt (cmd) and running:
   pip install mss numpy pynput keyboard

3. Open Command Prompt:
   - Press the Windows key and search for “cmd.”

4. Navigate to your macro script:
   - Find where your macro.py is saved.
   - In Command Prompt, type:
     cd "path to the folder"

5. Run the macro:
   python macro.py
   

Notes for using the macro:
- Works if Roblox is in full screen.
- If you want to use it while minimized, you’ll need to modify the code 
— just leave your mouse on top of the fishing rod icon.
- Controls:
  - Press F3 to start.
  - Press F3 again to pause.
  - Press F4 or Ctrl+C in the Command Prompt to fully stop.
- Remember to pause the macro when you’re done fishing, or your mouse will be a auto clicker.
